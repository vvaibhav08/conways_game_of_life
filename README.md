# John Conway's game of life

## Python adventures
With this code I am trying to expand the classical JCGoL by introducing reinforcement learning. The idea is to see if AI can learn the underlying rules instead of just mimicking the game. Will keep updating this. For now you can run this on your local machine by installing the poetry env (`poetry install` from root), and then running:
```
poetry run python src/game.py "random"
```

## Web version
Just a small effort to practice my web development. To be deployed on my personal website.
